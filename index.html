  <b>Meet The Team</b>
</p>

<p class=p3 style="text-align: center">
  G13 Technologies is a thriving group of developers based in Australia, who are studying IT at RMIT University.
  <br>
  This website will allow you to learn about each member of this enthusiastic team in detail. You will also see that each member has something unique they can offer in our team environment, which makes them invaluable to G13 Technologies. Each person in the team was asked to undertake 3 personality tests each, to better understand who each other are, and what they can offer in this ambitious team. These tests were a <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test" style="color: #4d2600">Myer's-Briggs test</a>, a learning style test of each individual's choosing and one other test they feel would give apropriate information as to their personality. These results are in each person's bio below. Let's meet the team!

  Nadir was born in Kilkenny, Ireland on April 18th, 1996. His family travelled to Australia for permanent residency in 1998. His heritage is a mix of Egyptian on his father’s side and Sudanese/Syrian on his mother’s side. Nadir went to school at Toowoomba Grammar School, and later worked for a few years as a repair technican for computers and phones (mainly Apple devices) and software related troubleshooting/repairs. His main hobby is video games, as he has been playing them since the age of 8. Nadir’s interest in IT has always been a subconscious one. His childhood and adolescence revolved around technology. He believes the convenience technology provides to him to be limitless. Whether accessing a GPS on his phone for directions or being able to ask any question through Google, technology has been a big part of his life. His decision to have a better grasp of IT comes largely from his experience in repair work.  Nadir has a good attitude to customer service and has stated, that he finds it, “nice to help people out with issues they themselves can't fix.” Nadir's ideal job is as a Mechatronic Engineer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nadir's Myer's-Briggs test showed his personality is an INTP-T, or Logicial. He also took a <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles.shtml" style="color: #4d2600">learning style test</a> online. This test showed his perfered learning style to be visual, and he completed a <a href="https://www.psychometricinstitute.com.au/Psychometric-Test-Guide/Numerical-Reasoning-Test-Guide/Numerical_Course___PracticeTests.html" style="color: #4d2600">numeracal test</a>, which reported his numeracy reasoning to be in the top 80% of participants. All these results are indicative of someone who follows a pattern of logic and a set of rules, personally and professionally. These attributes are great traits in a team environment.

  Luke was born in Australia, and his heritage is mostly German on his mothers side, and various European nationalities on his fathers side. He is an English speaker from birth and also speaks Japanese. After completing high school, he spent a few years learning Japanese via self study. One of his main hobbies is playing or reading about video games. He generally
  likes to stick to RPG and action-based games. One of his favourite series is “Trails of..” or Kiseki.
  In the later years of primary school, he became interested in playing around with the family computer. He started with games, and ended up getting into more complex computing, such as image editing and coding. In high school, his parents bought him his first computer. He then started playing more with hardware out of interest. This lead to him spending time breaking and reparing his computer. Luke's ideal job is as an IT Project Manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luke's Myer's-Briggs test showed him to be an INTJ, or Architect. His <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles.shtml" style="color: #4d2600">learning style test</a> proved he is a visual/tactile learner, and after completion of the <a href="https://www.truity.com/view/tests/big-five-personality" style="color: #4d2600">Big 5 Personality test</a>, his recorded score was Extroversion 1, Emotional Stability 66, Agreeableness 45, Conscientiousness 84, Intellect/Imagination 34. These results mean Luke is more of an independent worker who learns visually and through hands-on experience rather than reading.
  Luke prefers to work alone on deligated tasks, which works well in a group setting. This is a great asset to the team as he is unlikely to get involved in conflicts.

   Joseph has resided in the Gippsland region of Victoria, Australia since birth, and was raised in a family of 5 on a small country property. His education to date is completion of year 10 Cambridge in high school, year 11 VCE, a Certificate II in Security Operations and is currently undergoing a Certificate III in Appliance Servicing at TAFE through a full-time apprenticeship. He is also an Australian Defence Force member as a Combat Engineer in the Army Reserves. In terms of pastimes, he likes to study subjects that interest him and to build audio systems from scratch. Joseph’s interest in IT sparked quite recently. He got into IT through his interest in the Finance Industry. He has always had a brain for numbers and calculations, and this drove him to start a Finance Degree through Open Universities Australia. During his financial studies, he was required to complete IT components. This has kickstarted his interest in the ever-growing IT industry and has helped him find an understanding of the importance of IT in this day and age, and also given him a drive to try and find potential ideas and projects that can be used as valuable tools in his future finance career. Joseph's ideal job is as a Financial Advisor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joseph's result in the Myer's-Briggs test told us he is an ESFJ-A, or Consul. His <a href="https://www.learning-styles-online.com/inventory/login.php" style="color: #4d2600">learning style test</a> showed he learns best by use of logic, reason and systems. His third test, <a href="https://www.shelleycarson.com/creative-brain-test" style="color: #4d2600">Shelley Carson Creativity Test</a>, resulted in saying his creativity is deliberate and not spontaneous. With these  attributes, Joseph has a strong sense of responsibillity and is a people pleaser. This makes him a valuable team member.

His past education has also been with RMIT, having completing his diploma of Logistics in April 2015. Due to Ajmul's past education in the IT industry, he has a very deep knowledge of the industry and tools available to IT professionals. He also has a passionate interest in film making and has even started to produce his own films. He is interested in IT because information technology plays a very important role in every sector of business. He feels that nowadays businesses are using IT more by involving tools such as online shopping apps into their operating procedures. Ajmul believes that in logistics and supply chains operation technology is valuable, and this will only increase over the next few years. Ajmul is interested in IT because it is the future, and has said that in the near future IT will be the only alternative. Ajmul's idea job is as a Supply and Demand Planner.
 <br>
 <br>
  Ajmul's Myer's-Briggs test</a> showed his personality to be an ENFJ-A, or a Protagonist. His <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml" style="color: #4d2600">learning style test</a> showed he learns better through visual and auditorial means. To get a more concrete idea of his personality, Ajmul did another personality test via <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml" style="color: #4d2600">another</a> site which gave the same result, an ENFJ. A protagonist brings leadership and the ability to motivate helps the team strive for the best result.

  While she was not born in Australia, Sanjana has lived here nearly her whole life. She received her high school certificate in 2013 and started working in admin/customer service roles. Studying Information Technology was always in the back of her mind since she finished high school, but she never took the steps to work towards a degree until recently. One of her current hobbies is playing the guitar: she purchased a guitar on eBay and has used Youtube tutorials to learn how to play. Sanjana is fascinated in how lines of text can create incredible pieces of technology, such as the smartphones and social media which allow communication across the globe. She has always been the "go to" person in her family for anything related to technology and has a passion for learning more about coding. She also took IT as an elective in Year 10 and did very well in the subject. Her interest in IT continues to grow and she wants a career in the IT industry. Sanjana's ideal job is as an Analyst Programmer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sanjana's Myer's Briggs Test results showed she is an INFJ-T, or Advocate. Her <a href="https://personalitymax.com" style="color: #4d2600">learning style test</a> tells us she learns best through visual input. For her last test, she chose a <a href="https://www.assessmentday.co.uk/situational-judgement-test.htm" style="color: #4d2600">Situational Judgement test</a>, and her results showed her situational judgement to be extremely good. With Sanjana's results, she can bring creativity and good judgement to any team she is a part of, which will greatly benifit G13 Technologies.

  <b>Comparison & Contrast Of Ideal Jobs</b>
</p>

  <br>

<p class=p3>
  Within G13 Technologies, there is quite a diverse range of ideal jobs. Nadir's dream job is to become a Mecatronic Engineer. As a Mechatronic Engineer, Nadir will be working on smart machines (machines that are aware of their suroundings, and can make decisions). Luke would like to become an IT Project Manager. In this role, Luke would be responsible for overseeing any given project, and would also be responsible for the success or failure of the project he is put in charge of. Joseph intends to become a Financial Advisor. In this role, Joseph would be a consultant that specialises in organising and creating plans for finance and investments. Ajmul desires to become a Supply and Demand Planner. In this role, Ajmul will be in charge of setting up plans for a company's rate of supply and demand. Ajmul will be responsible for learning about his company's given market, and with that knowledge, put forward a plan as to how production should proceed to keep product supply as close to the rate of demand as possible. Hayley would like to become a Quality Assurance Analyst. In this job, Hayley would be part of a team of developers, and her job would be to update old software and to test newly created software to make sure they are functioning porperly, and maintained. Sanjana is striving to become a Analyst Programmer. This job will require Sanjana to use multiple coding languages to build, develop and implement programs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everyone's dream jobs are completely different but are all necessary in the IT industry. Because of this diversity, these jobs very rarely entail doing the same thing as each other. This is a very positive aspect of G13 Technologies. Our team can work in different areas of the same company with ease and without stepping on each other's toes. As an example, if the team decided to go down the path of producing smart machines of some sort, everyone would have their own sections, and would be working in their specialised areas. Nadir would develope the smart machines while Luke oversees the projects. Joseph would create a finacial plan for the project and make sure the finaces are all balanced and in order. Ajmul would study the smart machine market and get an idea of demand to give us knowledge of the production we will need to be successful in our chosen market. Hayley would maintain the current software of our product, update it accordingly, and test the newly created software to make sure it is to standard. Sanjana would be part our programming team to write the original coding required for our smart machine to function and perform the way it is designed to. This is just a single example of how, even though the ideal jobs and members of G13 Technologies are so different from one other, they can all work together as an organised team, to produce and maintain a successful IT project.
