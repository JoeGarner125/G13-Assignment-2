  Nadir was born in Kilkenny, Ireland on April 18th, 1996. His family travelled to Australia for permanent residency in 1998. His heritage is a mix of Egyptian on his father’s side and Sudanese/Syrian on his mother’s side. Nadir went to school at Toowoomba Grammar School, and later worked for a few years as a repair technican for computers, phones, mainly Apple devices, and software related troubleshooting/repairs as well. His main hobby is video games, and has been playing them since around the age of 8. Nadir’s interest in IT has always been a subconscious one. His childhood and adolescence revolved around technology. The conveniences provided to him by technology, he believes to be limitless. Whether accessing a GPS on his phone for directions or being able to ask any question through google, technology has been a big part of his life. The decision to have a better grasp of IT comes largely from his experience in repair work.  Nadir has a good attitude to customer service and had stated, he finds it, “nice to help people out with issues they themselves couldn’t fix.” Nadir's ideal job is as a Mechatronic Engineer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nadir's Myer's-Briggs test showed his personality is an INTP-T, or logicial. He also took a <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles.shtml" style="color: #4d2600">learning style test</a> online, this test showed his perfered learning style to be visual, and he completed a <a href="https://www.psychometricinstitute.com.au/Psychometric-Test-Guide/Numerical-Reasoning-Test-Guide/Numerical_Course___PracticeTests.html" style="color: #4d2600">numeracal test</a>, this reported his numeracy reasoning to be in the top 80% of test taker. All these results are indicative of someone who follows a pattern of logic and a set of rules, personally and professionally. These attributes can be a great traits in a team environment.

  Luke was born in Australia, and his heritage is mostly German on his mothers side, and various European nationalities on his fathers side. He is an English speaker from birth, but can also speak Japanese as well. After completing high school, he spent a few years learning Japanese via self study. One of his main hobbies is playing or reading about video games. I generally
  stick to RPG and action-based games. One of his favourite series is “Trails of..” or Kiseki.
  During the end of primary school he became interested in playing around with the family computer. He started with games, ended up getting into more complex computing, such as image editing and coding. In high school, his parents bought him his own first computer, and he started playing more with hardware out of interest, and spent a fair portion of his time breaking and fixing his computer. Luke's Ideal job is as an IT Project Manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luke's Myer's-Briggs test showed him to be an INTJ, or Architect. His <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles.shtml" style="color: #4d2600">learning style test</a> proved he is a visual/tactile learner. And after completion of the <a href="https://www.truity.com/view/tests/big-five-personality" style="color: #4d2600">Big 5 Personality test</a>, his recorded score was Extroversion 1, Emotional Stability 66, Agreeableness 45, Conscientiousness 84, Intellect/Imagination 34. Thes results mean, Luke is more of an independent worker and that he learns via simple methods, by seeing or doing rather than reading.
  He has a preference of working alone, which means he is able to be deligated tasks to perform alone, and will thrive. He is also unlikely to get involved in emotional conflicts, which is very valuable in a group scenario as conflicts can be devestating to a team's performance and morale.

   Joseph has resided in the Gippsland region of Victoria, in Australia, since birth, and was raised in a family of 5 on a small country property. His education to date is completion of yr10 Cambridge in high school, yr11 VCE, Certificate II in Security Operations and is currently undergoing a Certificate III in Appliance Servicing at TAFE through a full-time apprenticeship. He is also an Australian Defence Force member as a Combat Engineer in the Army Reserves. In terms of pastimes, he either studies a subject that interests him, or builds audio systems from scratch. Joseph’s interest in IT sparked quite recently. He got into IT through his interest in the Finance Industry. He has always had a brain for numbers and calculations, and this drove him to start a Finance Degree through Open Universities Australia. During his financial studies, he was required to complete IT components. This has kickstarted his interest in the ever-growing IT industry and has helped him find an understanding of the importance of IT in this day and age, and also given him a drive to try and find potential ideas and projects that can be used as valuable tools in his future finance career. Joseph's ideal job is as a Financial Advisor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joseph's result in the Myer's-Briggs test told us he is an ESFJ-A, or Consul. His <a href="https://www.learning-styles-online.com/inventory/login.php" style="color: #4d2600">learning style test</a> showed he learns best by use of logic, reason and systems. His third test, <a href="https://www.shelleycarson.com/creative-brain-test" style="color: #4d2600">Shelley Carson Creativity Test</a>, resulted in saying his creativity is deliberate and not spontanious. With these  attributes, Joseph has a strong sense of responsibillity and is a people pleaser. This makes him a valuable a team member.

  Ajmul's Myer's-Briggs test</a> showed his personality to be an ENFJ-A, or a Protagonist. His <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml" style="color: #4d2600">learning style test</a> presented that he learns better through visual and auditory means other that tactile. To get a more concrete idea of his personality, Ajmul did another personality test via <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml" style="color: #4d2600">another</a> site, and it resulted in the same result, an ENFJ.

  Sanjana, although was not originally born in Australia, grew up here since she was of a very young age. She got her high school certificate in 2013 and started working in admin/customer service type of roles. Studying Information Technology was always in the back of her mind since she finished high school, but never took the steps to work towards a degree until recently. One of her current hobbies is learning the guitar. She purchased a guitar on eBay, and has used youtube tutorials to learn how to play. IT fascinates Sanjana in how lines of text can create incredible pieces of technology, such as the smartphones we use today, to using social media to communicate with people across the globe. She would like to learn in the way of coding, as she has a passion for it. She has always been the go to person in her family for anything technologically related. Sanjana also took IT as an elective in year 10 and did really well in the subject. It was from there that her interest in IT grew to what it is today, and knew she wanted a career in the IT industry. Sanjana's ideal job is as an Analyst Programmer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sanjana's Myer's Briggs Test results showed she is an INFJ-T, or advocate. Her <a href="https://personalitymax.com" style="color: #4d2600">learning style test</a> tells us she learns best through visual input. For her last test, she chose a <a href="https://www.assessmentday.co.uk/situational-judgement-test.htm" style="color: #4d2600">situational Judgement test</a>, and her results showed her situational judgement to be extremely good. With Sanjana's results, she can bring creativity, and good judgement to her team.

  <b>Comparison & Contrast Of Ideal Jobs</b>
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
  Within G13 Technologies, there is quite a diverse range of ideal jobs. Nadir's dream job is to become a mecatronic engineer. As a Mechatronic engineer, Nadir will be working on smart machines (machines that are aware of their suroundings, and can make decisions). Luke would like to become an IT Project Manager. In this role, Luke would be resopnsible for overseeing any given project, and would also be responsible for the success or failure of the project he is put in charge of. Joseph intends to become a Financial Advisor. In this role, Joseph would be basically a consultant that specialises in organising and creating plans for finance and investments. Ajmul desires to become a Supply and Demand Planner. In this role, Ajmul will be in charge of setting un plans for a company's rate of supply and demand. Ajmul will be responsible for learning about his company's given market, and with that knowledge, put forward a plan as to how production should proceed, to keep product's supply as lose to the rate of demand as possible. Hayley would like to become a Quality Assurance Analyst. In this job, Hayley would be part of a team of developers, and her job would be to update old software and to test newly created software to make sure they are functioning porperly, and maintained. Sanjana is striving to become a Analyst Programmer. This job will require Sanjana to use muliple coding languages to build, develop and impliment programs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everyone's dream jobs are completely different but are all necessary in the IT industry. Because of this diversity, their' jobs very rarely would entail doing the same thing as each other. This is a very positive aspect of G13 Technologies. Our team can work in different areas of the same company with ease and without stepping on each other's toes. As an example, if the team decided to go down the path of producing smart machines of some sort, everyone would have their own sections, and would be doing what they are specialised in. Nadir would be a developer of the smart machines, while Luke oversees the projects involved, via a managerial role, Joseph would create a finacial plan for the project and make sure the finaces are all ballanced and in order, Ajmul would study the smart machine market and get an idea of demand, to give us the knowledge of what sort of production we will need to be successful in our chosen market, Hayley would maintain the current software of our product, update it according, and test the newly created software to make sure it is to standard, and Sanjana would be part our programming team to write the original coding required for our smart machine to function and perform the way they are designed to. This is just a single example of how, even though the ideal jobs and members of G13 Technologies are so different from one other, they can all work together as an organised team, to produce and maintain a successful IT project.
